SENTINIX 0.70.5 (SENTINIX 1 beta02):

    - Changed version numbering to a more traditional style:
	- SENTINIX 0.XX are beta versions of SENTINIX 1.
	- SENTINIX 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 - stable releases.
	- SENTINIX 1.XX are beta versions of SENTINIX 2.0, etc.

    - Added "--with-perl-modules" to Net-SNMP build.

    - Replaced fileutils, sh-utils and textutils to GNU's coreutils
      ( http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ ).

    - Added the missing /cdrom directory for mounting /dev/cdrom (fstab).

    - Added auto-mounting of /mfs (oMFS, openMosix File System) when running
      openMosix.

    - Upgraded several applications:

        grep, groff and libtool are newer in SENTINIX than available on
        ftp.gnu.org. The SENTINIX versions were downloaded before GNU decided
        to "confirm their authenticity". No problems have been detected or
        reported with these newer versions.

    - Fixed an "exit" bug in the rc.d-scripts that caused init to exit
      prematurely after an included rc-script (included from rc.M) had
      commanded "exit".

    - The initrd installation scripts are now able to install SENTINIX on a
      Compaq/HP Proliant server with a SmartArray RAID configuration. This was
      not possible in SENTINIX 1 Beta01. It should also be possible to install
      SENTINIX on a server with a MYLEX RAID configuration.

    - Added ipfm, iptraf, tcptrace, ipaudit, ngrep and lsof contributed by
      Duane Dunston (duane at sukkha.info - http://sukkha.info/).

    - LILO setup has now more options. The user may choose "linear" or
      "lba32" among other things.

    - Fixed the installation and setup scripts to support Compaq SmartArray
      RAID controller, and hopefully also MYLEX RAID controllers.

    - Updated the old MAKEDEV to the most recent version found on Debian's
      site. "MAKEDEV generic-i386" now generates /dev/ida/, /dev/rd/,
      /dev/cciss/, /dev/usb/ and a few more, enabling, among other devices,
      Compaq SmartArray and MYLEX controllers to be used.

    - The installation CD may now be used to boot a diskless openMosix node.

    - Downgraded to Linux 2.4.21 due to an SMP problem with 2.4.22 and the
      openMosix patch.

    - Attempted to add the Migshm-1.4 patch to the "om" and "omsmp" kernels,
      but caused PHP to segfault when running Cacti's 5 minute crontab job
      (cmd.php). Migshm was removed, the "om" and "omsmp" kernels are (still)
      plain openMosix-1.

    - Renamed the "default" kernel to "plain".

    - Renamed the "SNMPTools" menu in the GUI to "Network Tools".

    - Added a "dig" CGI front-end for making DNS queries.

    - Added a "netstat" CGI front-end for obtaining local networking
      information.

    - /etc/cron.weekly/nessus moved to /etc/cron.monthly (running
      nessus-update-plugins once every month).

    - Snort/SnortCenter starts with only the default Snort rules activated, not
      everything like before.

    - Snort/SnortCenter (including Sensor Agent) starts with the portscan
      preprocessor activated.

    - The MySQL output plugin in Snort/SnortCenter is now configured as "alert"
      and not "log" (as before) by default.

    - /etc/rc.d/rc.snortcenter keeps /var/log/snort/portscan.log 0644 so that
      the user may use the "portscan events" feature in ACID ("Alert Console"
      from SnortCenter).

    - /etc/rc.d/rc.nessus now actually does create the "nessus" user (with
      password "nessus") as it was suppose to do.

SENTINIX 1 beta01:

    - Initial release.
