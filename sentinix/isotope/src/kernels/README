COMPILING THE KERNELS

Just type "./build" or "sh build" to compile and install all kernels for
SENTINIX. If you add a kernel yourself you must also edit
/isotope/isolinux/isolinux.cfg and message.txt.

It compiles OK with gcc 2.95.3.


HOW TO UPDATE THE KERNELS

Put the new .tar.bz2, the new openMosix bz2 patch and the new Migshm patch in
this directory (/isotope/src/kernels). Edit the "config" file (symlinked from
this directory) and change the KVERSION variable to the new kernel version.
Unpack the .tar.bz2 file. Enter the directory and copy the old "config.plain"
and "config.smp" to the kernel directory, e.g.:

root@sandbox:/isotope/src/kernels/linux-2.4.21# cp ../config.plain ../config.smp .

Run "make menuconfig" and from there load "config.plain". Unless you want to
change something or add another feature, just save it, overwrite the
"config.plain" file. Do the same with "config.smp". When you're done copy them
back to their old place, e.g.:

root@sandbox:/isotope/src/kernels/linux-2.4.21# cp config.plain config.smp ..

Now, apply the openMosix patch and the Migshm patch, e.g.:

root@sandbox:/isotope/src/kernels/linux-2.4.21# bzcat ../openMosix-2.4.21-1.bz2 | patch -Np1
...
root@sandbox:/isotope/src/kernels/linux-2.4.21# cat ../patch-Migshm-2.4.21.diff | patch -Np1
...

Do the same as you did previously with the "config.plain" and the "config.smp"
file, copy "config.om" and "config.omsmp" to the kernel directory and run "make
menuconfig". Load the "config.om", save and overwrite it, do the same thing
with "config.omsmp". Copy "config.om" and "config.omsmp" back to ".." as you
did with "config.plain" and "config.smp".

Finish by copying "config.om" to /usr/src/linux/.

That's it! You may also want to check out /usr/src/README, there are some
variables to change in the source tree.

Good luck!
