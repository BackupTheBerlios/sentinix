These programs are already compiled and installed. If you'd like to 
recompile them, you'll need uclibc. You also want to edit the path to 
i386-uclibc-gcc in the "config" file.

uClibc-0.9.17.tar.gz is included in this source tree.
You can try to execute "sh build.uclibc" in order to build it, if that 
doesn't work, edit "build.uclibc" or compile and install it manually. 
Please note; /usr/src/linux is the default Linux source code directory, 
change this in the "config" file. Linux has to be configured (not
"make mrproper", but "make menuconfig" or "make config").
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/autoconf.h must be present!
