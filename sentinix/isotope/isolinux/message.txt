ATTENTION! 1 minute timeout until booting as openMosix node!

If you intend to install SENTINIX now, type in the kernel you want to boot. If
you want this box to act as an openMosix node, simply press <return> or wait
until the timeout has expired. E.g.: typing "smp" and pressing <return> will
boot the Linux SMP kernel. Available kernels:

    0bplain0e  - Linux compiled for uni-processor machines.
    0bsmp0e    - Linux SMP (2 or more processors).
    0bom0e     - openMosix uni-processor (transparent HPC clustering).
    0bomsmp0e  - openMosix SMP kernel.

You may also pass custom command variables to the kernel. For example, to boot
the om kernel and mount /dev/hda1 as root (starting init from hda1), type:

    0fom root=/dev/hda1 noinitrd ro0e
