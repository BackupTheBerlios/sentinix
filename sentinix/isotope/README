ABOUT ISOTOPE

This package (/isotope) will make a SENTINIX installation CD (ISO-image)
similar (or exactly) as one available on http://sentinix.org/.

You may want to look through the "config" file and, perhaps, change these
default values:

# Below, the speed of your CD recorder (speed to record in):
CDRSPEED=16
# Speed to record CDRW discs:
CDRWSPEED=4
# SCSI (or scsi-generic) device to use:
CDRDEV=0,0

Important! You have to have compiled SENTINIX (/usr/src/build-all) in order to
compile the "isotope" software or create an ISO.

After having compiled SENTINIX (the /usr/src/build-all script) do this:

1. cd to /isotope
2. Run ./build.sources
3. Run ./build.iso
4. If all is well, insert a blank CD-R(W) and run ./mkrealcd or ./mkcdrw
