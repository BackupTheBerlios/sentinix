The SENTINIX Source Tree
------------------------

 1. To enter the automatic build system you must chroot into it, do this by
    typing:

    $ ./schroot

    As the root user on your regular Linux system.

 2. Change directory to /usr/src:
 
    $ cd /usr/src

 3. Start the compilation process by executing the build-all script, but
    make sure you don't have MySQL running:
 
    $ make

    This will give you some options, you should start with:

    $ make sentinix

    This step will take about 3 hours on an AMD 1800+ with an ATA-100
    hard disk.

 4. When finished, logout of the chroot environment by simply pressing Ctrl+D.

 5. Re-enter the build system, but first you may want to edit "schroot" and
    replace "/bin/bash" with "/bin/bash --login", then type:

    $ ./schroot

 6. Change directory to /isotope:

    $ cd /isotope

 7. You may want to read the README file in that directory and perhaps edit the    
    "config" file, then you would want to type:

    $ make sources

    Then run:

    $ make iso

 8. You are now ready to create the Sentinix CD. Insert an empty/rewritable
    CD-R in your recorder and type either:

    $ make realcd

    ...to indicate that you want to burn a CD-R, or:

    $ make cdrw

    ...to indicate that you want to burn a CD-RW. The CD-RW will be blanked
    before burning (that's the only difference).

 9. That's it! Good luck!
