ABOUT NETWORK INTERFACE BONDING

The Linux kernel provides something called "bonding" or "channel
bonding", which is called "Etherchannel" by Cisco and "Trunking" by Sun.

If you have two Ethernet connections to some other computer, you can
make them behave like one double speed connection using this driver.
Naturally, this has to be supported at the other end as well, either
with a similar Bonding Linux driver, a Cisco 5500 switch or a
SunTrunking SunSoft driver.

HOW TO SET UP CHANNEL BONDING IN SENTINIX

First add a "bond0" virtual interface by selecting "Add a virtual
interface to the list". Then, in the IP address field for eth0 and eth1
(or two other Ethernet interfaces) write "bonding" and in the
netmask/master fields for eth0 and eth1 write "bond0". Now enter the IP
address (or "dhcp") and netmask (if IP="dhcp", leave netmask blank) you
want for the bond0 interface. Save and exit.
