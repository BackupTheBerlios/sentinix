Nessus is made up of two parts : a client and a server. You need a Unix-like
system to use the server (Linux is just fine). In this test, I used the standard
client <i>nessus</i>, mainly because I wrote it and because it is the only one
that supports the cipher layer.

<li> First : download and install <i>nessusd</i> and <i>nessus</i> 
<ul>
You can download the latest version of Nessus <a href="http://www.nessus.org/nessus_2_0.html">here</a>.
See the installation instructions to find out how to compile it.
</ul>

<li> Second : create a nessusd account
<ul>


The nessusd server has its own users database, each user having a 
a set of restrictions. This allows you to share a single nessusd server
for a whole network and different administrators who will only test
their part of the network.<p>
The utility <i>nessus-adduser</i> takes care of the creation of a new account :
<blockquote>
<pre>
# nessus-adduser

Addition of a new nessusd user
------------------------------

Login : renaud
Authentication (pass/cert) [pass] : pass
Password : secret

User rules
----------
nessusd has a rules system which allows you to restrict the hosts
that renaud2 has the right to test. For instance, you may want
him to be able to scan his own host only.

Please see the nessus-adduser(8) man page for the rules syntax

Enter the rules for this user, and hit ctrl-D once you are done : 
(the user can have an empty rules set)

deny 10.163.156.1
allow 10.163.156.0/24
default deny

Login            : renaud
Password         : secret
DN		 :
Rules            :

deny 10.163.156.1
allow 10.163.156.0/24
default deny


Is that ok (y/n) ? [y] y

user added.
</pre></blockquote>



</ul>



<li> Third : configure your nessus daemon
<ul>
In the file /usr/local/etc/nessus/nessusd.conf, I can set several options for nessusd. 
Typically this is where you can specify the resources you want nessusd to use, 
the speed at which it should read data, and so onimages.<br>
Note that if you don't have a nessusd.conf file,
nessusd will create one for you !
</ul>



<li> Start nessusd
<ul>
Once all of this is done, I can safely start nessusd as root :
<blockquote>
<pre>
nessusd -D
</pre>
</blockquote>
</ul>
