 . Warning found on port echo (7/tcp)


    The 'echo' port is open. This port is
    not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
    since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
    of service. You should really disable this service.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Information found on port echo (7/tcp)


    An echo server is running on this port

 . Vulnerability found on port telnet (23/tcp) : 


    
    The Telnet server does not return an expected number of replies
    when it receives a long sequence of 'Are You There' commands.
    This probably means it overflows one of its internal buffers and
    crashes. It is likely an attacker could abuse this bug to gain
    control over the remote host's superuser.
    
    For more information, see:
    http://www.team-teso.net/advisories/teso-advisory-011.tar.gz
    
    Solution: Comment out the 'telnet' line in /etc/inetd.conf.
    Risk factor : High

    BID : 3064

 . Vulnerability found on port telnet (23/tcp) : 


    
    It is possible to reboot the remote host by connecting to the telnet
    port and providing a bad username and password.
     
    
    This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCdw81244.
    
    An attacker may use this flaw to prevent your access point from
    working properly.
    
    Solution : http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/Aironet-Telnet.shtml
    Risk factor : High
    CVE : CAN-2002-0545
    BID : 4461

 . Warning found on port telnet (23/tcp)


    The Telnet service is running.
    This service is dangerous in the sense that
    it is not ciphered - that is, everyone can sniff
    the data that passes between the telnet client
    and the telnet server. This includes logins
    and passwords.
    
    You should disable this service and use OpenSSH instead.

 . Vulnerability found on port ssh (22/tcp) : 


    
    You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.4
    
    There is a flaw in this version that can be exploited remotely to
    give an attacker a shell on this host.
    
    Note that several distribution patched this hole without changing
    the version number of OpenSSH. Since Nessus solely relied on the
    banner of the remote SSH server to perform this check, this might
    be a false positive.
    
    If you are running a RedHat host, make sure that the command :
              rpm -q openssh-server
       
    Returns :
     openssh-server-3.1p1-6
    
    
    Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4 or contact your vendor for a patch
    Risk factor : High
    CVE : CAN-2002-0639, CAN-2002-0640
    BID : 5093

 . Vulnerability found on port ssh (22/tcp) : 


     
    You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.0.2.

    variables export that can allow a local user to execute
    command with root privileges.
    This problem affect only versions prior than 3.0.2, and when
    the UseLogin feature is enabled (usually disabled by default)
    
    Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.0.2 or apply the patch for prior
    versions. (Available at: ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH)
    
    Risk factor : High (If UseLogin is enabled, and locally)
    CVE : CVE-2001-0872
    BID : 3614

 . Vulnerability found on port ssh (22/tcp) : 


    
    You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.0.1.
    
    Versions older than 3.0.1 are vulnerable to a flaw in which
    an attacker may authenticate, provided that Kerberos V support
    has been enabled (which is not the case by default). 
    It is also vulnerable as an excessive memory clearing bug, 
    believed to be unexploitable.
    
    *** You may ignore this warning if this host is not using
    *** Kerberos V
    
    Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.0.1
    Risk factor : Low (if you are not using Kerberos) or High (if kerberos is
     enabled)

    Risk factor : High
    CVE : CAN-2002-0575
    BID : 4560

 . Warning found on port ssh (22/tcp)


    
    The remote SSH daemon supports connections made
    using the version 1.33 and/or 1.5 of the SSH protocol.
    
    These protocols are not completely cryptographically
    safe so they should not be used.
    
    Solution : 
     If you use OpenSSH, set the option 'Protocol' to '2'
     If you use SSH.com's set the option 'Ssh1Compatibility' to 'no'
      
    Risk factor : Low

    this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on this host.
    
    Solution: Upgrade your ftp server software to the latest version.
    Risk factor : High
    
    CVE : CVE-2001-0550
    BID : 3581

 . Warning found on port ftp (21/tcp)


    This FTP service allows anonymous logins. If you do not
     want to share data with anyone you do not know, then you should deactivate
     the anonymous account, since it can only cause troubles.
     Under most Unix system, doing : 
      echo ftp >> /etc/ftpusers
     will correct this.
     
     Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0497

 . Warning found on port ftp (21/tcp)


    It is possible to gather the
    real path of the public area of the ftp server
    (like /home/ftp) by issuing the following
    command :
    
     CWD
     
    This problem may help an attacker to find where
    to put a .rhost file using other security
    flaws.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0201

 . Warning found on port ftp (21/tcp)


    The remote FTP server allows users to make any amount
    of PASV commands, thus blocking the free ports for legitimate services and
    consuming file descriptors.
    
    Solution: upgrade your FTP server to a version which solves this problem.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    CVE : CVE-1999-0079
    BID : 271

 . Warning found on port chargen (19/tcp)


    The chargen service is running.
    The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine. 
    
    When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
    like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP,
     it 
    will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will 
    continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
     two
    machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at each 
    other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
          
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Information found on port chargen (19/tcp)


    Chargen is running on this port

 . Warning found on port daytime (13/tcp)


    The daytime service is running.
    The date format issued by this service
    may sometimes help an attacker to guess
    the operating system type. 
    
    In addition to that, when the UDP version of
    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Vulnerability found on port smtp (25/tcp) : 


    
    The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
    may be vulnerable to the -bt overflow attack which
    allows any local user to execute arbitrary commands as root.
    
    Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail
    Risk factor : High
    Note : This vulnerability is _local_ only

 . Vulnerability found on port smtp (25/tcp) : 


    
    The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
    may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow its DNS handling code.
    
    The owner of a malicious name server could use this flaw
    to execute arbitrary code on this host.
    
    
    Solution : Upgrade to Sendmail 8.12.5
    Risk factor : High
    CVE : CAN-2002-0906
    BID : 5122

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    The remote SMTP server
    answers to the EXPN and/or VRFY commands.
    
    The EXPN command can be used to find 
    the delivery address of mail aliases, or 
    even the full name of the recipients, and 
    the VRFY command may be used to check the 
    validity of an account.
    
    
    Your mailer should not allow remote users to
    use any of these commands, because it gives
    them too much information.
    
    
    Solution : if you are using Sendmail, add the 
    option
     O PrivacyOptions=goaway
    in /etc/sendmail.cf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0531

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote SMTP server is vulnerable to a redirection
    attack. That is, if a mail is sent to :
    
      user@hostname1@victim
      
    Then the remote SMTP server (victim) will happily send the
    mail to :
      user@hostname1
      
    Using this flaw, an attacker may route a message
    through your firewall, in order to exploit other
    SMTP servers that can not be reached from the
    outside.
    
    *** THIS WARNING MAY BE A FALSE POSITIVE, SINCE
        SOME SMTP SERVERS LIKE POSTFIX WILL NOT
        COMPLAIN BUT DROP THIS MESSAGE ***
        
        
    Solution : if you are using sendmail, then at the top
    of ruleset 98, in /etc/sendmail.cf, insert :
    R$*@$*@$*       $#error $@ 5.7.1 $: '551 Sorry, no redirections.'
    
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    The remote SMTP server allows the relaying. This means that
    it allows spammers to use your mail server to send their mails to
    the world, thus wasting your network bandwidth.
    
    Risk factor : Low/Medium
    
    Solution : configure your SMTP server so that it can't be used as a relay
               any more.
    CVE : CAN-1999-0512

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote SMTP server allows anyone to
    use it as a mail relay, provided that the source address 
    is set to '<>'. 
    This problem allows any spammer to use your mail server 
    to spam the world, thus blacklisting your mailserver, and
    using your network resources.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    
    Solution : reconfigure this server properly
    CVE : CVE-1999-0819

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
    might be vulnerable to a queue destruction when a local user
    runs
     sendmail -q -h1000
    
    If you system does not allow users to process the queue (which
    is the default), you are not vulnerable.
    
    Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail or 
    do not allow users to process the queue (RestrictQRun option)
    Risk factor : Low
    Note : This vulnerability is _local_ only
    CVE : CAN-2001-0714

    he is not allowed to access those information directly, by running
     sendmail -q -d0-nnnn.xxx
    where nnnn & xxx are debugging levels.
    
    If users are not allowed to process the queue (which is the default)
    then you are not vulnerable.
    
    Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail or 
    do not allow users to process the queue (RestrictQRun option)
    Risk factor : Very low / none

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    The 'finger' service provides useful information
    to attackers, since it allow them to gain usernames, check if a machine
    is being used, and so on... 
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out the 'finger' line in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0612

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    The remote finger daemon accepts
    to redirect requests. That is, users can perform
    requests like :
      finger user@host@victim
    
    This allows an attacker to use your computer
    as a relay to gather information on another
    network, making the other network think you
    are making the requests.
    
    Solution: disable your finger daemon (comment out
    the finger line in /etc/inetd.conf) or 
    install a more secure one.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0105

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    There is a bug in the finger service
    which will make it display the list of the accounts that
    have never been used, when anyone issues the request :
    
      finger 'a b c d e f g h'@target
      
    This list will help an attacker to guess the operating
    system type. It will also tell him which accounts have
    never been used, which will often make him focus his
    attacks on these accounts.
    
    Solution : disable the finger service in /etc/inetd.conf, or
    apply the patches from Sun.
    
    Risk factor : Medium

    The walld RPC service is running. 
    It is usually used by the administrator
    to tell something to the users of a
    network by making a message appear
    on their screen.
    
    Since this service lacks any kind
    of authentication, an attacker
    may use it to trick users into
    doing something (change their password,
    leave the console, or worse), by sending
    a message which would appear to be
    written by the administrator.
    
    It can also be used as a denial of service
    attack, by continually sending garbage
    to the users screens, preventing them
    from working properly.

 . Warning found on port chargen (19/tcp)


    The chargen service is running.
    The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine. 
    
    When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
    like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP,
     it 
    will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will 
    continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
     two
    machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at each 
    other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
          
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Warning found on port qotd (17/tcp)


    The quote service (qotd) is running.
    
    A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 17. Once a connection 
    is established a short message is sent out the connection (and any 
    data received is thrown away). The service closes the connection 
    after sending the quote.
    
    Another quote of the day service is defined as a datagram based
    application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port 17.
    When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent containing 
    a quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).
    
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' which IP spoofs a packet between two machines
    running qotd. This will cause them to spew characters at each other,
    slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
    
    
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port daytime (13/tcp)


    The daytime service is running.
    The date format issued by this service
    may sometimes help an attacker to guess
    the operating system type. 
    
    In addition to that, when the UDP version of
    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Warning found on port echo (7/tcp)


    The 'echo' port is open. This port is
    not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
    since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
    of service. You should really disable this service.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Vulnerability found on port http (80/tcp) : 


    
    The IIS server appears to have the .HTR ISAPI filter mapped.
    
    At least one remote vulnerability has been discovered for the .HTR
    filter. This is detailed in Microsoft Advisory
    MS02-018, and gives remote SYSTEM level access to the web server. 
    
    It is recommended that even if you have patched this vulnerability that
    you unmap the .HTR extension, and any other unused ISAPI extensions
    if they are not required for the operation of your site.
    
    Solution: 
    To unmap the .HTR extension:
     1.Open Internet Services Manager. 
     2.Right-click the Web server choose Properties from the context menu. 
     3.Master Properties 
     4.Select WWW Service -> Edit -> HomeDirectory -> Configuration 
    and remove the reference to .htr from the list.

    IIS 5 has support for the Internet Printing Protocol(IPP), which is 
    enabled in a default install. The protocol is implemented in IIS5 as an 
    ISAPI extension. At least one security problem (a buffer overflow)
    has been found with that extension in the past, so we recommend
    you disable it if you do not use this functionality.
    
    Solution: 
    To unmap the .printer extension:
     1.Open Internet Services Manager. 
     2.Right-click the Web server choose Properties from the context menu. 
     3.Master Properties 
     4.Select WWW Service -> Edit -> HomeDirectory -> Configuration 
    and remove the reference to .printer from the list.

    Your webserver supports the TRACE and/or TRACK methods. It has been
    shown that servers supporting this method are subject
    to cross-site-scripting attacks, dubbed XST for
    'Cross-Site-Tracing', when used in conjunction with
    various weaknesses in browsers.
    
    An attacker may use this flaw to trick your
    legitimate web users to give him their 
    credentials.
    
    Solution: Disable these methods.
    
    
    If you are using Apache, add the following lines for each virtual
    host in your configuration file :
    
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
        RewriteRule .* - [F]
    
    If you are using Microsoft IIS, use the URLScan tool to deny HTTP TRACE
    requests or to permit only the methods needed to meet site requirements
    and policy.

 . Vulnerability found on port netbios-ssn (139/tcp) : 


    
    . It was possible to log into the remote host using a NULL session.
    The concept of a NULL session is to provide a null username and
    a null password, which grants the user the 'guest' access
    
    To prevent null sessions, see MS KB Article Q143474 (NT 4.0) and
    Q246261 (Windows 2000). 
    Note that this won't completely disable null sessions, but will 
    prevent them from connecting to IPC$

 . Warning found on port echo (7/udp)


    The 'echo' port is open. This port is
    not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
    since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
    of service. You should really disable this service.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Information found on port ms-term-serv (3389/tcp)


    
    The Terminal Services are enabled on the remote host.
    
    Terminal Services allow a Windows user to remotely obtain
    a graphical login (and therefore act as a local user on the
    remote host).
    
    If an attacker gains a valid login and password, he may
    be able to use this service to gain further access
    on the remote host.
    
    
    Solution : Disable the Terminal Services if you do not use them
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port daytime (13/udp)


    The daytime service is running.
    The date format issued by this service
    may sometimes help an attacker to guess
    the operating system type. 
    
    In addition to that, when the UDP version of
    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Warning found on port qotd (17/udp)


    The quote service (qotd) is running.
    
    A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 17. Once a connection 
    is established a short message is sent out the connection (and any 
    data received is thrown away). The service closes the connection 
    after sending the quote.
    
    Another quote of the day service is defined as a datagram based
    application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port 17.
    When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent containing 
    a quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).
    
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' which IP spoofs a packet between two machines
    running qotd. This will cause them to spew characters at each other,
    slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
    
    
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

 . Warning found on port chargen (19/udp)


    The chargen service is running.
    The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine. 
    
    When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
    like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP,
     it 
    will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will 
    continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
     two
    machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at each 
    other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
          
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

 . Vulnerability found on port netbios-ssn (139/tcp) : 


    
    . It was possible to log into the remote host using a NULL session.
    The concept of a NULL session is to provide a null username and
    a null password, which grants the user the 'guest' access
    
    To prevent null sessions, see MS KB Article Q143474 (NT 4.0) and
    Q246261 (Windows 2000). 
    Note that this won't completely disable null sessions, but will 
    prevent them from connecting to IPC$

 . Warning found on port chargen (19/tcp)


    The chargen service is running.
    The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine. 
    
    When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
    like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP,
     it 
    will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will 
    continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
     two
    machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at each 
    other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
          
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

    In addition to that, when the UDP version of
    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

    the VRFY command may be used to check the 
    validity of an account.
    
    
    Your mailer should not allow remote users to
    use any of these commands, because it gives
    them too much information.

    Nessus sent several emails containing the EICAR
    test strings in them to the postmaster of
    the remote SMTP server.
    
    The EICAR test string is a fake virus which
    triggers anti-viruses, in order to make sure
    they run.
    
    Nessus attempted to e-mail this string five times,
    with different codings each time, in order to attempt
    to fool the remote anti-virus (if any).
    
    
    If there is an antivirus filter, these messages should
    all be blocked.
    
    *** To determine if the remote host is vulnerable, see
    *** if any mail arrived to the postmaster of this host
    
    Solution: Install an antivirus / upgrade it

 . Warning found on port xdmcp (177/udp)


    
    The remote host is running XDMCP.
    
    This protocol is used to provide X display connections for 
    X terminals. XDMCP is completely insecure, since the traffic and
    passwords are not encrypted. 
    
    An attacker may use this flaw to capture all the keystrokes of
    the users using this host through their X terminal, including
    passwords.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    Solution : Disable XDMCP

 . Warning found on port echo (7/udp)


    The 'echo' port is open. This port is
    not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
    since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
    of service. You should really disable this service.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Warning found on port daytime (13/udp)


    The daytime service is running.
    The date format issued by this service
    may sometimes help an attacker to guess
    the operating system type. 
    
    In addition to that, when the UDP version of
    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low

 . Vulnerability found on port smtp (25/tcp) : 


    
    
    The remote SMTP server did not complain when issued the
    command :
     MAIL FROM: |testing
     
    This probably means that it is possible to send mail 
    that will be bounced to a program, which is 
    a serious threat, since this allows anyone to execute 
    arbitrary commands on this host.
    
    *** This security hole might be a false positive, since
    *** some MTAs will not complain to this test, but instead
    *** just drop the message silently
       
    Solution : upgrade your MTA or change it.
    
    Risk factor : High
    CVE : CVE-1999-0203

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    The remote SMTP server
    answers to the EXPN and/or VRFY commands.
    
    The EXPN command can be used to find 
    the delivery address of mail aliases, or 
    even the full name of the recipients, and 
    the VRFY command may be used to check the 
    validity of an account.
    
    
    Your mailer should not allow remote users to
    use any of these commands, because it gives
    them too much information.
    
    
    Solution : if you are using Sendmail, add the 
    option
     O PrivacyOptions=goaway
    in /etc/sendmail.cf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0531

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote SMTP server is vulnerable to a redirection
    attack. That is, if a mail is sent to :
    
      user@hostname1@victim
      
    Then the remote SMTP server (victim) will happily send the
    mail to :
      user@hostname1
      
    Using this flaw, an attacker may route a message
    through your firewall, in order to exploit other
    SMTP servers that can not be reached from the
    outside.
    
    *** THIS WARNING MAY BE A FALSE POSITIVE, SINCE
        SOME SMTP SERVERS LIKE POSTFIX WILL NOT
        COMPLAIN BUT DROP THIS MESSAGE ***
        
        
    Solution : if you are using sendmail, then at the top
    of ruleset 98, in /etc/sendmail.cf, insert :
    R$*@$*@$*       $#error $@ 5.7.1 $: '551 Sorry, no redirections.'
    
    Risk factor : Low

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    The remote SMTP server allows the relaying. This means that
    it allows spammers to use your mail server to send their mails to
    the world, thus wasting your network bandwidth.
    
    Risk factor : Low/Medium
    
    Solution : configure your SMTP server so that it can't be used as a relay
               any more.
    CVE : CAN-1999-0512

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote SMTP server allows anyone to
    use it as a mail relay, provided that the source address 
    is set to '<>'. 
    This problem allows any spammer to use your mail server 
    to spam the world, thus blacklisting your mailserver, and
    using your network resources.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    
    Solution : reconfigure this server properly
    CVE : CVE-1999-0819

 . Warning found on port smtp (25/tcp)


    
    The remote SMTP server seems to allow remote users to
    send mail anonymously by providing arguments that are 
    too long to the HELO command (more than 1024 chars).
    
    This problem may allow malicious users to send hate
    mail or threatening mail using your server,
    and keep their anonymity.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : If you are using sendmail, upgrade to
    version 8.9.x or newer. If you do not run sendmail, contact
    your vendor.

 . Vulnerability found on port telnet (23/tcp) : 


    
    The Telnet server does not return an expected number of replies
    when it receives a long sequence of 'Are You There' commands.
    This probably means it overflows one of its internal buffers and

 . Warning found on port chargen (19/tcp)


    The chargen service is running.
    The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine. 
    
    When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters (something
    like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via UDP,
     it 
    will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will 
    continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 
    
    An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet between
     two
    machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at each 
    other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
          
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

    daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
    to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
    a possible denial of service.
    
    Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Warning found on port echo (7/tcp)


    The 'echo' port is open. This port is
    not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
    since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
    of service. You should really disable this service.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0103

 . Information found on port echo (7/tcp)


    An echo server is running on this port

 . Information found on port time (37/tcp)


    A time server seems to be running on this port

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    The 'finger' service provides useful information
    to attackers, since it allow them to gain usernames, check if a machine
    is being used, and so on... 
    
    Risk factor : Low
    
    Solution : comment out the 'finger' line in /etc/inetd.conf
    CVE : CVE-1999-0612

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    The remote finger daemon accepts
    to redirect requests. That is, users can perform
    requests like :
      finger user@host@victim
    
    This allows an attacker to use your computer
    as a relay to gather information on another
    network, making the other network think you
    are making the requests.
    
    Solution: disable your finger daemon (comment out
    the finger line in /etc/inetd.conf) or 
    install a more secure one.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0105

 . Warning found on port finger (79/tcp)


    There is a bug in the finger service
    which will make it display the list of the accounts that
    have never been used, when anyone issues the request :
    
      finger 'a b c d e f g h'@target
      
    This list will help an attacker to guess the operating
    system type. It will also tell him which accounts have
    never been used, which will often make him focus his
    attacks on these accounts.
    
    Solution : disable the finger service in /etc/inetd.conf, or
    apply the patches from Sun.
    
    Risk factor : Medium

 . Warning found on port login (513/tcp)


    The rlogin service is running.
    This service is dangerous in the sense that
    it is not ciphered - that is, everyone can sniff
    the data that passes between the rlogin client
    and the rlogin server. This includes logins
    and passwords.
    
    You should disable this service and use openssh instead
    (www.openssh.com)
    
    Solution : Comment out the 'rlogin' line in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0651

 . Warning found on port exec (512/tcp)


    
    The rexecd service is open. 
    Because rexecd does not provide any good
    means of authentication, it can be
    used by an attacker to scan a third party
    host, giving you troubles or bypassing
    your firewall.
    
    Solution : comment out the 'exec' line 
    in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Medium
    CVE : CAN-1999-0618

 . Information found on port printer (515/tcp)

 . Warning found on port shell (514/tcp)


    The rsh service is running.
    This service is dangerous in the sense that
    it is not ciphered - that is, everyone can sniff
    the data that passes between the rsh client
    and the rsh server. This includes logins
    and passwords.
    
    You should disable this service and use ssh instead.
    
    Solution : Comment out the 'rsh' line in /etc/inetd.conf.
    
    Risk factor : Low
    CVE : CAN-1999-0651

    a buffer overflow attack which allows an attacker
    to gain root privileges
    
    *** This warning might be a false positive,
    *** as no real overflow was performed
    
    Solution : See http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-31.html
    to determine if you are vulnerable or deactivate
    this service (comment out the line 'dtspc' in /etc/inetd.conf)
