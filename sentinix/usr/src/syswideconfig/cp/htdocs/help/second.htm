In the <a href="first.htm">first</a> step, we saw how I configured my
<i>nessusd</i>, as root, to suit my needs. Now, I connect to it as a simple
user.


<p>
<li>Fire up <i>nessus</i> : 
<ul>
<p>
<img src="images/start_client.jpg">
<p>
I immediately click on <b>Login</b>, since this setup is correct. Since I
never connected to this server, it will show me its certificate and ask me
if I accept it. Note that if I wanted to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks, I should
configure my client so that it uses a recognized Certificate Authority to check
SSL keys, but this is beyond the scope of the demo.
<p>
Once I am connected, the <b>Log in</b> button changes to <b>Log out</b>, and
a <b>Connected</b> label appears at its left.
</ul>

<p>
<li>The security checks configuration
<ul>
<p>
<img src="images/plugins.jpg">
<p>
I let all the security check to be performed, except the Denial of Service
attacks, because I do not need my hosts to crash at this moment <p>

Clicking on a plugin name will pop up a window explaining what the plugin
does.
</ul>

<p>
<li>The plugins preferences
<ul>
<p>
<img src="images/plugins_prefs.jpg">
<p>

You can give extra information to some security checks so that 
the audit is more complete. For instance, if you give a SMB login and
account to nessusd, then you will be given local information about
the remote Windows host (such as the missing security patches).<br>
Many options can be set through this panel.
</ul>


<p>
<li>The scan options
<ul>
<p>
<img src="images/scan_opt.jpg">
<p>

In this section, I choose which port scanner I want to use, how many hosts
I want to have scanned at the same time, and how many plugins I want to run
in parallel against each host. If I were to scan a firewalled web server, I could
check the option "consider unscanned ports as closed" and only specify
to scan port 80 - this would greatly speed up the scan.
</ul>
<p>
<li>Define the targets : 
<ul>
<p>
<img src="images/target.jpg">
<p>
The hosts of my local network are using private IP adresses, so
entering '10.163.156.1-10.163.156.1.254' is fine. I do not check the 'Perform a DNS transfer
zone' option, since it would make DNS transfer on <i>fr.nessus.org</i>
and <i>nessus.org</i>, and it would be useless, since it would not gain any new
hosts.
<p>
I could use the following options to define my targets:
<dl>
  <dt>10.163.156.1</dt>
  <dd>A single IP address.</dd>

  <dt>10.163.156.1-254</dt>
  <dd>A range of IP addresses.</dd>

  <dt>10.163.156.1-10.163.159.254</dt>
  <dd>Another range of IP addresses.</dd>

  <dt>10.163.156.1/24</dt>
  <dd>Again a range of IP addresses in <a href="http://www.urec.cnrs.fr/autres_techno/BGP4/CIDR_faq.html">CIDR</a> notation.</dd>

  <dt>hope.fr.nessus.org</dt>
  <dd>A hostname in Full Qualified Domain Name notation.</dd>

  <dt>hope</dt>
  <dd>A hostname (as long as it is resolvable on the server).</dd>

  <dt>prof, 10.163.156.0/24, images.</dt>
  <dd>Any combination of the formentioned forms seperated by a comma.</dd>
</dl>
</ul>




<p>
<li>The rules section
<ul>
<p><img src="images/rules.jpg">
<p>

The rules allow a user to restrict his test. For instance, I want to test
10.163.156.1/24, except 10.163.156.5. The ruleset I entered allows me to do that.
<p>
<p>
Once all of this is done, I can start the test :
