<span class="textPageHeader">Making Graphs the Easy Way: Polling Hosts</span>

<p>Polling hosts are organizationally at the center of Cacti and provide a way to store information about hosts that
you are graphing. Not only does Cacti allow you to keep your graphs organized using hosts, but provides an interface to
create new graphs through each host. Remember "SNMP Interfaces" from Cacti 0.6.x? Polling hosts is where this functionality
has moved plus so much more. To create a new host in Cacti, select "Polling Hosts" on the menu under the "Data Gathering"
heading. Click "Add" to the right, and you will be presented with some fields:</p>

<table class="field" cellspacing="0">
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Description
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			This is the field that you will typically use to identify this host within Cacti. It is recommended
			that you keep this short for formatting reasons, but something identifiable as well. The hostname
			usually works well here, if the host has one.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldTwo">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Host Template
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			If you want to associate this host with a <a href="section4_3.htm">host template</a>, select one here. Host templates will not
			enforce field values like graph or data templates will. Instead they will provide a list of graph
			templates and data queries that belong to this host type upon applying the template.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Hostname
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			If you want to enter the complete DNS hostname for this host, enter it here. Currently this field is
			not used for data gathering, so you can really enter anything here that you wish.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldTwo">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Management IP
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			You must enter the IP address of the host here. The value of this field determines how data is gathered
			from this host where necessary.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			SNMP Community
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			If this host has SNMP capabilities, enter the read only community string here.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldTwo">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			SNMP Username
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			If this host has SNMP version 3 capabilities, enter the SNMP username for the host here.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			SNMP Password
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			If this host has SNMP version 3 capabilities, enter the SNMP password for the host here.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldTwo">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			SNMP Version
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			Choose the version to use when retrieving SNMP information from this host. If you are using 64-bit
			counters, you must select version 2. If you are relying on the SNMP username/password fields, you must
			select version 3.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>When you are finished filling in these fields for your host, click the "Create" button. You will will be redirected back to
the host edit page, where you will notice a few changes. First of all, one additional field appears.</p>

<table class="field" cellspacing="0">
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Associated Data Query
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			You can choose to associate a data query with the host by selecting it from the list and clicking the "Add"
			button. Once you click the "Add" button, the query will be executed against this host, and the results
			will be displayed in a new box after being redirected back to this page.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>There will also be a few new boxes depending on if you selected a host template on the initial create screen.</p> 

<p class="textParagraphHeader">[box] Create Graphs + Data Sources</p>

<p>This box enables you to create new graphs from a graph template based on this host. You will see a dropdown with a list of
available graph templates to choose from. If you want to create a graph that you select in this dropdown, you must make sure
to check the checkbox to the right of it. If the host is associated with a host template, you may see additional graph templates
already listed in this box. This enables you to easily create graphs that are based on this host type.</p>

<p class="textParagraphHeader">[box] Data Query [...]</p>

<p>For each data query that is associated with the host, you will see a box containing the results of that query. You will notice
a checkbox to the right of each row that is returned from the query, enabling you to create graphs. Also make sure to pay attention
to the dropdown below each data query box. Since a data query can potentially output many different things, you will sometimes
have to choose what you want to graph from this dropdown.

<p class="textParagraphHeader">Creating Graphs Using Hosts</p>

<p>To create new graphs from the polling hosts screen, select each relevant checkbox in the "Create Graphs + Data Sources" or 
"Data Query" boxes. You can also use the "check all" checkbox to the right of the header in each of these boxes. When you are
finished checking boxes, or marking graphs for creation, click the "Save" button.</p>

<p>You will be redirected to a screen that is used to gather any needed information from the user before creating the
graphs. If you selected any graphs from the "Create Graphs + Data Sources" box, you will see a box with each field that
has a suggested value. These fields will of course already be filled in with the suggested value, and since it is only
"suggested", the user will have the opportunity to change it here.</p>

<p>You will also see one box for each data query you are creating graphs from. You will be presented with a list of input 
fields from that data query, and asked to choose which one you want to base the query on. You typically want to choose 
something here that does not change often. You will also be asked for the values of any fields that Cacti cannot derive 
the values of.</p>

<p>When you are finished with all of the fields on this page, click the "Create" button at the bottom. All of your selected
graphs will be created, and you will be redirected back to the main polling hosts page.</p>
