<span class="textPageHeader">Host Templates</span>

<p>Host templates in Cacti serve a different purpose then data and graph templates. Instead of abstracting the fields
of a host, a host template allows you to associate graph templates and data queries with a given host type. This way when
you assign a host template to a host, all of the relevant graphs to that host type are only one click away from the user.
To create a new host template in Cacti, select the "Host Templates" option under the "Templates" heading. Once on that screen, 
click "Add" on the right. You will be presented with a few fields to populate:</p>

<table class="field" cellspacing="0">
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Name
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			Give the host template a name that you can use to identify it throughout Cacti. You will see this name
			on the "Polling Hosts" screen where you can assign a host template with a host.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldTwo">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Associated Graph Templates
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			Choose any number of graph templates that are relevant to this host type. When the user applies this host
			template to a host, they will be given the opportunity to choose which graphs to actually create for
			that host.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="fieldOne">
		<td class="fieldName" width="150">
			Associated Data Queries
		</td>
		<td class="fieldDescription">
			Choose any number of data queries that are supported by this host type. When this host template is added
			to a host, all of the data queries selected here will be executed against the current host. The user
			will then have the opportunity to create graphs based on the results of each data query.
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>When you are finished filling in these fields, click the "Create" button and you will be redirected back to this page.
If you selected any associated graph templates, the first thing you will notice is a "Suggested Values" box for each selected
graph template. Suggested values allow you to "suggest" default values to the user for fields that would otherwise not have a 
value. For each suggested value, you must enter a field name and corresponding value. For a complete description of valid
field names and value syntax, check out the section on <a href="section8_1.htm">suggested values</a>. 

<p>Once you are finished with your new host template, you can click "Save" to return to the main host templates screen. From here
you can either apply your host template to a host, or create another host template.</p>
