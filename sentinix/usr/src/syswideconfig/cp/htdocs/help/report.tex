\section*{Introduction}
In this test, Nessus has tested 9 hosts and found \textbf{54 severe security holes}, as well as 113 security warnings and 303 notes.These problems can easily be used to break into your network. You should have a close look at them and correct them as soon as possible.\\
Note that there is a big number of problems for a single network of this size.\\
We strongly suggest that you correct them as soon as you can, although we know it is not always possible.\\
We recommand that you take a closer look at \verb+10.163.156.10+, as it is the host that is the most likely to be the entry point of any cracker.
On the overall, Nessus has given to the security of this network the mark E because of the number of vulnerabilities found. A script kid should be able to break into your network rather easily.\\
There is room for improvement, and \textbf{we strongly suggest that you take the appropriate measures to solve these problems \textit{as soon as possible}}
If you were considering hiring some security consultant to determine the security of your network, we strongly suggest you do so, because this should save your network.

\subsection{Details of the vulnerabilities}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : echo (7/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The 'echo' port is open. This port is
not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial
of service. You should really disable this service.

Risk factor : Low

Solution : comment out 'echo' in /etc/inetd.conf
CVE : CVE-1999-0103
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
An echo server is running on this port
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : telnet (23/tcp)}
Security holes :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The Telnet server does not return an expected number of replies
when it receives a long sequence of 'Are You There' commands.
This probably means it overflows one of its internal buffers and
crashes. It is likely an attacker could abuse this bug to gain
control over the remote host's superuser.

For more information, see:
http://www.team-teso.net/advisories/teso-advisory-011.tar.gz

Solution: Comment out the 'telnet' line in /etc/inetd.conf.
Risk factor : High
CVE : CVE-2001-0554
BID : 3064
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
It is possible to reboot the remote host by connecting to the telnet
port and providing a bad username and password.
 

This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID CSCdw81244.

An attacker may use this flaw to prevent your access point from
working properly.

Solution : http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/Aironet-Telnet.shtml
Risk factor : High
CVE : CAN-2002-0545
BID : 4461
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The Telnet service is running.
This service is dangerous in the sense that
it is not ciphered - that is, everyone can sniff
the data that passes between the telnet client
and the telnet server. This includes logins
and passwords.

You should disable this service and use OpenSSH instead.
(www.openssh.com)

Solution : Comment out the 'telnet' line in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0619
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
A telnet server seems to be running on this port
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
Remote telnet banner :


SunOS 5.8

\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : ssh (22/tcp)}
Security holes :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.4

There is a flaw in this version that can be exploited remotely to
give an attacker a shell on this host.

Note that several distribution patched this hole without changing
the version number of OpenSSH. Since Nessus solely relied on the
banner of the remote SSH server to perform this check, this might
be a false positive.

If you are running a RedHat host, make sure that the command :
          rpm -q openssh-server
   
Returns :
 openssh-server-3.1p1-6


Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4 or contact your vendor for a patch
Risk factor : High
CVE : CAN-2002-0639, CAN-2002-0640
BID : 5093
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
 
You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.0.2.

Versions prior than 3.0.2 are vulnerable to an environment
variables export that can allow a local user to execute
command with root privileges.
This problem affect only versions prior than 3.0.2, and when
the UseLogin feature is enabled (usually disabled by default)

Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.0.2 or apply the patch for prior
versions. (Available at: ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH)

Risk factor : High (If UseLogin is enabled, and locally)
CVE : CVE-2001-0872
BID : 3614
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
You are running a version of OpenSSH which is older than 3.0.1.

Versions older than 3.0.1 are vulnerable to a flaw in which
an attacker may authenticate, provided that Kerberos V support
has been enabled (which is not the case by default). 
It is also vulnerable as an excessive memory clearing bug, 
believed to be unexploitable.

*** You may ignore this warning if this host is not using
*** Kerberos V

Solution : Upgrade to OpenSSH 3.0.1
Risk factor : Low (if you are not using Kerberos) or High (if kerberos
 is enabled)
CVE : CVE-2002-0083
BID : 3560, 4560, 4241
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
You are running a version of OpenSSH older than OpenSSH 3.2.1

A buffer overflow exists in the daemon if AFS is enabled on
your system, or if the options KerberosTgtPassing or
AFSTokenPassing are enabled.  Even in this scenario, the
vulnerability may be avoided by enabling UsePrivilegeSeparation.

Versions prior to 2.9.9 are vulnerable to a remote root
exploit. Versions prior to 3.2.1 are vulnerable to a local
root exploit.

Solution :
Upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSH

Risk factor : High
CVE : CAN-2002-0575
BID : 4560
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SSH daemon supports connections made
using the version 1.33 and/or 1.5 of the SSH protocol.

These protocols are not completely cryptographically
safe so they should not be used.

Solution : 
 If you use OpenSSH, set the option 'Protocol' to '2'
 If you use SSH.com's set the option 'Ssh1Compatibility' to 'no'
  
Risk factor : Low
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
An ssh server is running on this port
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SSH daemon supports the following versions of the
SSH protocol :

  . 1.33
  . 1.5
  . 1.99
  . 2.0

\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
Remote SSH version : SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_2.3.0p1
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : ftp (21/tcp)}
Security holes :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote FTP server seems to be vulnerable to an exhaustion
attack which may makes it consume all available memory on the remote
host when it receives the command :

 NLST /../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../*/../ 
 

Solution : upgrade to ProFTPd 1.2.2 if the remote server is proftpd,
or contact your vendor for a patch.

Reference : http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/169069

Risk factor : High
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
You seem to be running an FTP server which is vulnerable to the 'glob
 heap corruption'
flaw, which is known to be exploitable remotely against this server.
 An attacker may use 
this flaw to execute arbitrary commands on this host.

Solution: Upgrade your ftp server software to the latest version.
Risk factor : High

CVE : CVE-2001-0550
BID : 3581
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
This FTP service allows anonymous logins. If you do not
 want to share data with anyone you do not know, then you should
 deactivate
 the anonymous account, since it can only cause troubles.
 Under most Unix system, doing : 
  echo ftp >> /etc/ftpusers
 will correct this.
 
 Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0497
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
It is possible to gather the
real path of the public area of the ftp server
(like /home/ftp) by issuing the following
command :

 CWD
 
This problem may help an attacker to find where
to put a .rhost file using other security
flaws.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CVE-1999-0201
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote FTP server allows users to make any amount
of PASV commands, thus blocking the free ports for legitimate services
 and
consuming file descriptors.

Solution: upgrade your FTP server to a version which solves this
 problem.

Risk factor : Medium
CVE : CVE-1999-0079
BID : 271
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
An FTP server is running on this port.
Here is its banner : 
220 unknown FTP server (SunOS 5.8) ready.
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
Remote FTP server banner :
220 unknown FTP server (SunOS 5.8) ready.
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : chargen (19/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The chargen service is running.
The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine.
 

When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters
 (something
like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via
 UDP, it 
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
 
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 

An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet
 between two
machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
 each 
other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
      
Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CVE-1999-0103
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
Chargen is running on this port
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : daytime (13/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The daytime service is running.
The date format issued by this service
may sometimes help an attacker to guess
the operating system type. 

In addition to that, when the UDP version of
daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
a possible denial of service.

Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CVE-1999-0103
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : smtp (25/tcp)}
Security holes :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
may be vulnerable to the -bt overflow attack which
allows any local user to execute arbitrary commands as root.

Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail
Risk factor : High
Note : This vulnerability is _local_ only
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow its DNS handling code.

The owner of a malicious name server could use this flaw
to execute arbitrary code on this host.


Solution : Upgrade to Sendmail 8.12.5
Risk factor : High
CVE : CAN-2002-0906
BID : 5122
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SMTP server
answers to the EXPN and/or VRFY commands.

The EXPN command can be used to find 
the delivery address of mail aliases, or 
even the full name of the recipients, and 
the VRFY command may be used to check the 
validity of an account.


Your mailer should not allow remote users to
use any of these commands, because it gives
them too much information.


Solution : if you are using Sendmail, add the 
option
 O PrivacyOptions=goaway
in /etc/sendmail.cf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0531
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SMTP server is vulnerable to a redirection
attack. That is, if a mail is sent to :

  user@hostname1@victim
  
Then the remote SMTP server (victim) will happily send the
mail to :
  user@hostname1
  
Using this flaw, an attacker may route a message
through your firewall, in order to exploit other
SMTP servers that can not be reached from the
outside.

*** THIS WARNING MAY BE A FALSE POSITIVE, SINCE
    SOME SMTP SERVERS LIKE POSTFIX WILL NOT
    COMPLAIN BUT DROP THIS MESSAGE ***
    
    
Solution : if you are using sendmail, then at the top
of ruleset 98, in /etc/sendmail.cf, insert :
R$*@$*@$*       $#error $@ 5.7.1 $: '551 Sorry, no redirections.'

Risk factor : Low
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SMTP server allows the relaying. This means that
it allows spammers to use your mail server to send their mails to
the world, thus wasting your network bandwidth.

Risk factor : Low/Medium

Solution : configure your SMTP server so that it can't be used as a
 relay
           any more.
CVE : CAN-1999-0512
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote SMTP server allows anyone to
use it as a mail relay, provided that the source address 
is set to '<>'. 
This problem allows any spammer to use your mail server 
to spam the world, thus blacklisting your mailserver, and
using your network resources.

Risk factor : Medium

Solution : reconfigure this server properly
CVE : CVE-1999-0819
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote sendmail server, according to its version number,
might be vulnerable to a queue destruction when a local user
runs
 sendmail -q -h1000

If you system does not allow users to process the queue (which
is the default), you are not vulnerable.

Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail or 
do not allow users to process the queue (RestrictQRun option)
Risk factor : Low
Note : This vulnerability is _local_ only
CVE : CAN-2001-0714
BID : 3378
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
According to the version number of the remote mail server, 
a local user may be able to obtain the complete mail configuration
and other interesting information about the mail queue even if
he is not allowed to access those information directly, by running
 sendmail -q -d0-nnnn.xxx
where nnnn & xxx are debugging levels.

If users are not allowed to process the queue (which is the default)
then you are not vulnerable.

Solution : upgrade to the latest version of Sendmail or 
do not allow users to process the queue (RestrictQRun option)
Risk factor : Very low / none
Note : This vulnerability is _local_ only
CVE : CAN-2001-0715
BID : 3898
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
An SMTP server is running on this port
Here is its banner : 
220 sparky.fr.nessus.org ESMTP Sendmail 8.9.3+Sun/8.9.3; Fri, 21 Feb

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : time (37/tcp)}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
A time server seems to be running on this port
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : finger (79/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The 'finger' service provides useful information
to attackers, since it allow them to gain usernames, check if a
 machine
is being used, and so on... 

Risk factor : Low

Solution : comment out the 'finger' line in /etc/inetd.conf
CVE : CVE-1999-0612
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote finger daemon accepts
to redirect requests. That is, users can perform
requests like :
  finger user@host@victim

This allows an attacker to use your computer
as a relay to gather information on another
network, making the other network think you
are making the requests.

Solution: disable your finger daemon (comment out
the finger line in /etc/inetd.conf) or 
install a more secure one.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0105
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
There is a bug in the finger service
which will make it display the list of the accounts that
have never been used, when anyone issues the request :

  finger 'a b c d e f g h'@target
  
This list will help an attacker to guess the operating
system type. It will also tell him which accounts have
never been used, which will often make him focus his
attacks on these accounts.

Solution : disable the finger service in /etc/inetd.conf, or
apply the patches from Sun.

Risk factor : Medium
BID : 3457
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
Security note :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
A finger server seems to be running on this port
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}

(www.openssh.com)

Solution : Comment out the 'rlogin' line in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0651
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Problems regarding : exec (512/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The rexecd service is open. 
Because rexecd does not provide any good
means of authentication, it can be
used by an attacker to scan a third party
host, giving you troubles or bypassing
your firewall.

Solution : comment out the 'exec' line 
in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Medium
CVE : CAN-1999-0618
\end{verbatim}\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The walld RPC service is running. 
It is usually used by the administrator
to tell something to the users of a

Since this service lacks any kind
of authentication, an attacker
may use it to trick users into
doing something (change their password,
leave the console, or worse), by sending
a message which would appear to be
written by the administrator.

It can also be used as a denial of service
attack, by continually sending garbage
to the users screens, preventing them
from working properly.

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : chargen (19/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The chargen service is running.
The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine.
 

When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters
 (something
like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via
 UDP, it 
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
 
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 

An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet
 between two
machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
 each 
other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
      
Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : qotd (17/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The quote service (qotd) is running.

A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 17. Once a connection
 
is established a short message is sent out the connection (and any 
data received is thrown away). The service closes the connection 
after sending the quote.

Another quote of the day service is defined as a datagram based
application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port
 17.
When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent containing 
a quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).


An easy attack is 'pingpong' which IP spoofs a packet between two
 machines
running qotd. This will cause them to spew characters at each other,
slowing the machines down and saturating the network.



Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

It is recommended that even if you have patched this vulnerability
 that
you unmap the .HTR extension, and any other unused ISAPI extensions
if they are not required for the operation of your site.

Solution: 
To unmap the .HTR extension:
 1.Open Internet Services Manager.

Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The IIS server appears to have the .IDA ISAPI filter mapped.

At least one remote vulnerability has been discovered for the .IDA
(indexing service) filter. This is detailed in Microsoft Advisory
MS01-033, and gives remote SYSTEM level access to the web server. 

It is recommended that even if you have patched this vulnerability
 that
you unmap the .IDA extension, and any other unused ISAPI extensions
if they are not required for the operation of your site.

Solution: 
To unmap the .IDA extension:
 1.Open Internet Services Manager. 
 2.Right-click the Web server choose Properties from the context menu.
 
 3.Master Properties 
 4.Select WWW Service -> Edit -> HomeDirectory -> Configuration 
and remove the reference to .ida from the list.

Risk factor : Medium
CVE : CAN-2002-0071
BID : 4474
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
IIS 5 has support for the Internet Printing Protocol(IPP), which is 
enabled in a default install. The protocol is implemented in IIS5 as
 an 
ISAPI extension. At least one security problem (a buffer overflow)
has been found with that extension in the past, so we recommend
you disable it if you do not use this functionality.

Solution: 
To unmap the .printer extension:
 1.Open Internet Services Manager. 
 2.Right-click the Web server choose Properties from the context menu.
 
 3.Master Properties 
 4.Select WWW Service -> Edit -> HomeDirectory -> Configuration 
and remove the reference to .printer from the list.

Reference : http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/181109

Risk factor : Low
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
Your webserver supports the TRACE and/or TRACK methods. It has been
shown that servers supporting this method are subject
to cross-site-scripting attacks, dubbed XST for
'Cross-Site-Tracing', when used in conjunction with
various weaknesses in browsers.

An attacker may use this flaw to trick your
legitimate web users to give him their 
credentials.

Solution: Disable these methods.


If you are using Apache, add the following lines for each virtual
host in your configuration file :

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
    RewriteRule .* - [F]

If you are using Microsoft IIS, use the URLScan tool to deny HTTP
 TRACE
requests or to permit only the methods needed to meet site
 requirements
and policy.

Risk factor : Medium
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
It is possible to retrieve the listing of the remote 
directories accessible via HTTP, rather than their index.html, 
using the Index Server service which provides WebDav capabilities
to this server.

This problem allows an attacker to gain more knowledge
about the remote host, and may make him aware of hidden
HTML files.

Solution : disable the Index Server service, or
see http://www.microsoft.com/technet/support/kb.asp?ID=272079
Risk factor : Low
CVE : CVE-2000-0951
BID : 1756
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote web server appears to be running with
Frontpage extensions. 

You should double check the configuration since
a lot of security problems have been found with
FrontPage when the configuration file is
not well set up.

Risk factor : High if your configuration file is
not well set up

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : qotd (17/udp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The quote service (qotd) is running.

A server listens for TCP connections on TCP port 17. Once a connection
 
is established a short message is sent out the connection (and any 
data received is thrown away). The service closes the connection 
after sending the quote.

Another quote of the day service is defined as a datagram based
application on UDP.  A server listens for UDP datagrams on UDP port
 17.
When a datagram is received, an answering datagram is sent containing 
a quote (the data in the received datagram is ignored).


An easy attack is 'pingpong' which IP spoofs a packet between two
 machines
running qotd. This will cause them to spew characters at each other,
slowing the machines down and saturating the network.

 UDP, it 
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
 
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 

An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet
 between two
machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
 each 
other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.

various weaknesses in browsers.

An attacker may use this flaw to trick your
legitimate web users to give him their 
credentials.

Solution: Disable these methods.


If you are using Apache, add the following lines for each virtual
host in your configuration file :

An attacker may use this flaw to trick your
legitimate web users to give him their

Solution: Disable these methods.


If you are using Apache, add the following lines for each virtual
host in your configuration file :

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} ^(TRACE|TRACK)
    RewriteRule .* - [F]

If you are using Microsoft IIS, use the URLScan tool to deny HTTP
 TRACE

Terminal Services allow a Windows user to remotely obtain
a graphical login (and therefore act as a local user on the
remote host).

If an attacker gains a valid login and password, he may
be able to use this service to gain further access
on the remote host.


Solution : Disable the Terminal Services if you do not use them

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : chargen (19/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The chargen service is running.
The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine.
 

When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters
 (something
like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via
 UDP, it 
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
 
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 

An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet
 between two
machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
 each 
other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
      
Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low

This probably means that it is possible to send mail 
that will be bounced to a program, which is 
a serious threat, since this allows anyone to execute 
arbitrary commands on this host.

*** This security hole might be a false positive, since
*** some MTAs will not complain to this test, but instead

The EXPN command can be used to find 
the delivery address of mail aliases, or 
even the full name of the recipients, and 
the VRFY command may be used to check the 
validity of an account.


Your mailer should not allow remote users to

The remote SMTP server seems to allow remote users to
send mail anonymously by providing arguments that are 
too long to the HELO command (more than 1024 chars).

This problem may allow malicious users to send hate
mail or threatening mail using your server,
and keep their anonymity.

Risk factor : Low

Solution : If you are using sendmail, upgrade to
version 8.9.x or newer. If you do not run sendmail, contact
your vendor.

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : telnet (23/tcp)}
Security holes :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote /bin/login seems to crash when it receives too many
environment variables.

An attacker may use this flaw to gain a root shell on this system.

See also : http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-34.html
Solution : Contact your vendor for a patch (or read the CERT advisory)
Risk factor : High
CVE : CVE-2001-0797
BID : 3681
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The Telnet server does not return an expected number of replies
when it receives a long sequence of 'Are You There' commands.
This probably means it overflows one of its internal buffers and
crashes. It is likely an attacker could abuse this bug to gain
control over the remote host's superuser.

For more information, see:
http://www.team-teso.net/advisories/teso-advisory-011.tar.gz

Solution: Comment out the 'telnet' line in /etc/inetd.conf.

You seem to be running an FTP server which is vulnerable to the
'glob heap corruption' flaw.
An attacker may use this problem to execute arbitrary commands on this
 host.

*** Nessus relied solely on the banner of the server to issue this

\subsubsection{Problems regarding : chargen (19/tcp)}
Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The chargen service is running.
The 'chargen' service should only be enabled when testing the machine.
 

When contacted, chargen responds with some random characters
 (something
like all the characters in the alphabet in a row). When contacted via
 UDP, it 
will respond with a single UDP packet. When contacted via TCP, it will
 
continue spewing characters until the client closes the connection. 

An easy attack is 'pingpong' in which an attacker spoofs a packet
 between two
machines running chargen. This will cause them to spew characters at
 each 
other, slowing the machines down and saturating the network.
      
Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CVE-1999-0103

Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The daytime service is running.
The date format issued by this service
may sometimes help an attacker to guess
the operating system type. 

In addition to that, when the UDP version of
daytime is running, an attacker may link it 
to the echo port using spoofing, thus creating
a possible denial of service.

Solution : disable this service in /etc/inetd.conf.

Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The 'echo' port is open. This port is
not of any use nowadays, and may be a source of problems, 
since it can be used along with other ports to perform a denial

Security warnings :\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}
The 'finger' service provides useful information
to attackers, since it allow them to gain usernames, check if a
 machine
is being used, and so on... 

Risk factor : Low

Solution : comment out the 'finger' line in /etc/inetd.conf
CVE : CVE-1999-0612
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
The remote finger daemon accepts
to redirect requests. That is, users can perform
requests like :
  finger user@host@victim

This allows an attacker to use your computer
as a relay to gather information on another
network, making the other network think you
are making the requests.

Solution: disable your finger daemon (comment out
the finger line in /etc/inetd.conf) or 
install a more secure one.

Risk factor : Low
CVE : CAN-1999-0105
\end{verbatim}\item \begin{verbatim}
There is a bug in the finger service
which will make it display the list of the accounts that
have never been used, when anyone issues the request :

  finger 'a b c d e f g h'@target
  
This list will help an attacker to guess the operating
system type. It will also tell him which accounts have
never been used, which will often make him focus his
attacks on these accounts.

Solution : disable the finger service in /etc/inetd.conf, or
apply the patches from Sun.

Risk factor : Medium

\section*{Conclusion}
A security scanner, such as Nessus, is not a garantee  of the security of your network.\\
A lot of factors can not be tested by a security scanner : the practices of the users of the network, the home-made services and CGIs, and so on... So, you should not have a false sense of security now that the test are done. We recommand that you monitor actively what happens on your firewall, and that you use some tools such as tripwire to restore your servers more easily in the case of an intrusion.\\
In addition to that, you must know that new security holes are found each week. That is why we recommand that you visit \verb+http://www.nessus.org/scripts.html+, which is a page that contains the test for all the holes that are published on public mailing lists such as BugTraq (see \verb+http://www.securityfocus.com+ for details) and test the security of your network on a (at least) weekly basis with the checks that are on this page.\\
